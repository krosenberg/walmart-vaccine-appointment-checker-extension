# Walmart Vaccine Appointment Checker

This extension runs when you go to https://www.walmart.com/pharmacy/clinical-services. You need to have a Walmart account and be logged in order for the extention to search for appointments.

On page load, the extension will query each Walmart location shown in the "Find a Pharmacy" list for vaccine appointments that are available in the next seven days. If a location has appointments, the location will turn green. Select the location with your mouse and press the "Continue" button.

If you change the location search or want to check again, use the "Check again" button at the top of the page.
